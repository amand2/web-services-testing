# Functional Testing APIs using RestAssured
This project contains examples of  functional  testing REST APIs using [RestAssured](https://github.com/jayway/rest-assured) . RestAssured is a library to simplify testing of REST APIs and provides a rich DSL. 
The manual is at [RestAssured Manual](https://code.google.com/p/rest-assured/wiki/Usage)  

#Sample Private API to test
We use the Restify TODO service to test our service. The instructions for installation is at
https://github.com/mcavage/node-restify/tree/master/examples/todoapp

==The Restify sample needs to be running to run the groovy and the scala tests.==

The following examples are provided :

* Java8 using Maven and JUnit
* Groovy with Spock & Gradle
* Scala using ScalaTest and sbt.

Detailed instructions are in the individual READMEs

##***Happy Testing !***
